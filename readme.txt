FileSize 0.1
------------

This program tells the size of a file.

The file has to be named

  d.d
  
and has to be placed in the same directory where the program itself is located.

Just invoke the program after compilation and it will tell you the size of the file  d.d.

The version number 0.1 was chosen because programs like this should take a file name as argument to masure its size.
However the implementation of using the arguments of an invocation could not be done yet because of the limited code space.

However this program is intended as a first test to actually deal with a file by opening it, doing some operations on it and finally close it again.
