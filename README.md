Version 1.0:

Improvement of the user- interaction by replacing the "out : "- statement
from the toolbox with a statement that the result is the size of the file.

So the usability now can be regarded as understandable enough to set the
version number to 1.0


Version 0.3

Fixing the issue of a segmentation fault if no file name is given as argument.


Version 0.2

Implemented the processing of arguments at invocation to give the name of the file to measure.


Version 0.1
